    <h2>Headlight Restoration</h2>
    <p>Do you have hazy, cloudy, or yellowed headlights? If you do, not only are the headlights an eyesore,
      but your headlights are no longer outputting the same amount of light. Headlights become hazy, cloudy, and yellowed over time as UV rays wear down the film protecting your plastic headlights. Our restoration service will have your headlights looking brand new. As well, we apply UV protection to the headlights so that the finish remains preserved.</p>
